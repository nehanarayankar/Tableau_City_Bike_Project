#Introduction
**
Welcome to my City Bike Share Data Analysis project! In this repository, I explore and analyze data from various city bike-sharing systems to uncover insights into bike usage patterns, peak hours, customer demographics, and environmental impacts. By leveraging data visualization tools like Tableau and conducting detailed statistical analysis, this project aims to provide actionable insights that can help optimize bike-sharing programs, improve city transportation infrastructure, and encourage sustainable commuting. Dive into the data and visualizations to explore the trends that shape urban mobility.
